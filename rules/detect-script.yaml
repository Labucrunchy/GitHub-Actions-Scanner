# This rule detects Javascript injection vulnerabilites in GitHub Actions yaml files.
# It checks for a match in a 'steps' block.
# It matches only if the action in the 'uses' block is matched by the regex: actions/github-script@.*
# It then checks for a match in a 'with' block containing a 'script' block.
# It then isolates the script and stores it in a metavariable for generic matching.
# It then finally checks to see if the context variables are used in the script directly and if so, matches.
